# Housing Prices in the Bay Area: An Introduction to Data Science

An initial analysis of real estate housing prices in the Bay Area

The repository must have a README.md file that communicates the libraries used, the motivation for the project, the files in the repository with a small description of each, a summary of the results of the analysis, and necessary acknowledgements.

# 1. Dependencies

The scripts in the Jupyter notebooks are written in Python 3.7+ using the below libraries:

## Data Manipulation

- [numpy](https://numpy.org/): for some mathematical computations and array manipulation; and
- [pandas](https://pandas.pydata.org/): for most of the data manipulation and analysis.

## Data Visualization

- [matplotlib](https://matplotlib.org/): for plotting basic graphs; and
- [seaborn](https://seaborn.pydata.org/): for generating more sophisticated graphs.

## Model Prediction

- [scikit-learn] (https://scikit-learn.org/): for machine learning tasks; and
- [scipy] (https://www.scipy.org/): for basic 2 dimensional linear regression and imputation of normal distributions.

Since production code was not written in mind, note that there may be issues with running the notebooks when running future versions of these packages.

# 2. Introduction

(intro TBA)

# 3. Files

This repository consists of the following files:

## Jupyter Notebooks

1. [Preprocessing](Preprocessing.ipynb): contains the scripts to clean the raw data extracted by the web scraper;
2. [Exploration](Exploration.ipynb): analyzes the data to get a better understanding of the Bay Area real estate; and
3. [Prediction](Prediction.ipynb): build a basic linear regression model to predict real estate prices.

## Data

1. raw.csv; and
2. clean.csv.

## Other

- This [README.md](README.md) file; and
- The license that governs this repository, i.e. [MIT License](LICENSE).

# 4. Summary of Results

I have also included a Medium article that is written for audiences without a data science background.
